</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is basically a way to keep files in a software system well organized.  It assigns one main repository for all of the files a project contains.  It makes it easier to makes changes to files because it checks one file out and then checks it back in, eliminating the file sharing problem.  Now a version control system (VCS) helps keep track of who does what to each file, where it is done, and what is different about the new files.  Version control system is a repository of files that can not be overwritten and also allows us to revert back to an older version of the file if mistakes are made. It also backs up files incase they are lost in the process of changing them.

</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">One can have several Remote Repositories, which are versions of our own projects that are stored either on the internet somewhere or within the server.  This repository can be shared with multiple people as you update it.  A Local Repository is a repository that is within a local machine belonging to an individual user.  You can create this by either creating a new repository or cloning and existing one into our own local machine.  This repository is used for local changes.

                <span class="text-muted">What is GIT and why use it?
</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GIT is a version control system that is fast and free.  We use GIT for projects that contains data that might need to be shared with multiple people.  Everyone has their own set of data that they can alter to fit their needs while it does not alter the identical data of another.  There are three very simple commands to add changes to the GIT program, which are Add, Commit, and Push which adds the updated data into a Local or Remote Repository for others to access if need be.  While those three commands are used the most, there are also a plethora of other commands to help our projects stay organized such as git status, git pull, git push and many more.
